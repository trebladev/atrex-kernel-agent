# One optimization iteration (clean session)

You are one **clean session** in a profile-driven GPU-kernel optimization campaign.
Run **exactly one cycle** — profile → pick ONE lever → edit → validate → bench → record — then **exit**.

Hard rules for this session:

- **Do NOT loop.** One cycle, then stop. There is no Stage 6 here — the orchestrator owns the outer loop and decides whether another session runs.
- **Do NOT try to reach the final target** in this session. Just make this one cycle count and hand off cleanly.
- The whole point of a clean session is a fresh context: you inherit state from disk, not from a prior conversation.

## Context

- Workspace: `{{WORKSPACE}}` — this is your cwd, and a git repo. **git HEAD is the best kernel so far.**
- You are producing version **v{{N}}**. Previous version: **v{{PREV}}**.
- `tools/`, `reference/`, `skills/`, `reference-projects/`, and `gpu-wiki/` are symlinked into the workspace — read/use them by relative path
  (`python tools/memory_manager.py --workspace .`, `reference/v_iteration.schema.json`).
- `.claude/skills/ncu-report-skill/` — NVIDIA profiling skill (Stage 1).
- `.claude/skills/KernelWiki/` — kernel optimization knowledge base (Stage 2 L1 search).
- `/humanize:gen-plan` — plan generation plugin (Stage 2, loaded via `--plugin-dir`).

This prompt is **self-contained** — it defines all stages (1–4), commit/revert rules, and record format.
Evidence format throughout: `evidence -> inference -> action`. Do Stages 1–4 once, then commit/revert/record and exit.

## Step A — Learn from prior sessions (read; do not redo their work)

1. Read `README.md` — the **Goal** (minimize the geomean of per-workload kernel latency), config (platform, target framework, `gpu_wiki_path`), and the ground-truth files. There are no pre-baked Stop Conditions — the orchestrator owns termination; your job is to cut the geomean latency this cycle while keeping every workload correct.
2. Cross-version digest — `python tools/memory_manager.py summary --workspace .` (where we are; the trajectory).
3. The latest entry, in full — `python tools/memory_manager.py read --workspace . --version v{{PREV}}`. Pay attention to:
   - **`open_directions`** — candidate leads the previous session left for you.
   - **`search_log` + `pitfalls_and_fixes`** across the digest — **recorded dead-ends. Do NOT repeat them.**
4. Profile reuse — if `profiles/v{{PREV}}/` holds a profile of the *current* HEAD kernel (carried forward),
   you may reuse it instead of re-profiling. Otherwise profile fresh in Step B.

**`open_directions` are priors, not orders.** Pick the most promising lead — **or**, if a fresh look at the
profile reveals a better lever, pursue that instead. The only hard constraint is: don't re-run a recorded dead-end.

**Consider shape bucketing when the evidence supports it.** Check `performance.latency_us_by_shape` and the
profile: if different-scale shapes are bottlenecked differently, a valid category is **shape specialization** —
group shapes into a few buckets of similar scale (not one path per shape) and dispatch inside `run()` to a
subkernel or tiling/block config per bucket. Many kernels don't need this — decide from memory, research, and
current latencies.

## Step B — One cycle (Stages 1–4)

Execute each stage (1–4) directly in this session. All rules are defined inline below.

### Stage 1 — Profile and Bottleneck Evidence Extraction

**Goal**: Profile the current kernel, place outputs in `profiles/v{{N}}/`, and extract concrete bottleneck evidence.

**Execution**: First create `profiles/v{{N}}/harness/profile_driver.py` locally. It must import the current
`kernel.py` plus immutable `input.py`, select a representative workload from `shapes.json`, allocate inputs,
warm up, and invoke `Model` repeatedly so the profiler captures real GPU kernels. The driver is profile-only;
it must not update memory. Collection and analysis then finish inside one sandbox job so a fresh pod is safe
and raw profiler binaries never become optimizer state. Run exactly one platform-specific command.

**NVIDIA**:
```bash
python tools/sandbox.py --sync profiles/v{{N}} -- \
  bash tools/profile_nvidia.sh profiles/v{{N}}/harness/profile_driver.py \
    --output-dir profiles/v{{N}} --source
```

For a named DSL kernel (especially a Triton `@triton.jit` function), append
`--kernel-name <exact_base_function_name>` to both NCU collections through this
wrapper. Use the exact name reported by NCU (for example
`--kernel-name _attn_fwd_kernel`), not a substring or a `regex:.*...*` guess.
Without a filter, NCU's default first-launch capture often selects a
`torch.randn`/input-generation elementwise kernel instead of the candidate.
After collection, verify that the `Kernel:` line in `summary.txt` names the
intended candidate kernel; a mismatched or empty capture is invalid and must be
rerun before writing `REPORT.md`.

**AMD**:
```bash
python tools/sandbox.py --sync profiles/v{{N}} -- \
  bash tools/profile_kernel.sh profiles/v{{N}}/harness/profile_driver.py \
    --output-dir profiles/v{{N}}
```

The wrapper synchronizes the small profile analysis and summary artifacts back locally. Raw
`.ncu-rep`/ATT binaries stay remote by default. Follow `.claude/skills/ncu-report-skill/SKILL.md` only for
interpreting the returned evidence, then write `profiles/v{{N}}/REPORT.md` locally. Pin any source-targeted
change to the line/SASS evidence produced by the NVIDIA `--source` run.

**Output**: `profiles/v{{N}}/REPORT.md` with bottleneck evidence, diagnosis, and ranked recommendations — this feeds Stage 2.

### Stage 2 — Evidence-Driven Research and Planning

**Goal**: Use Stage 1 evidence to find one optimization path and generate `plans/v{{N}}_plan.md` via `humanize:gen-plan`.

Execution steps:

1. **Mandatory reads**: workspace `README.md`, `gpu-wiki/README.md`, all unmasked `memory/v*.json`, historical `plans/v*_plan.md`.
2. **Parse historical Search Logs** from prior plans to build a used-knowledge set (deduplication reference).
3. **Determine stall count**: Count the number of consecutive most-recent reverted versions (no improvement) from the memory summary. Record as `STALL_COUNT`.
4. **Architecture-scoped L1 retrieval**: Read the target architecture from workspace `README.md`, then query main's architecture-first wiki before broad grep. Use narrow symptom, operator, and mechanism queries; open the returned pages and follow their local links:
   ```bash
   python3 gpu-wiki/scripts/query.py --arch <arch> --vendor <nvidia|amd> \
     --area docs --section kernel-opt --symptom <controlled-symptom>
   python3 gpu-wiki/scripts/query.py --arch <arch> --vendor <nvidia|amd> \
     --area docs --dsl <dsl> --operator <operator> \
     --section ref-docs --section pitfalls
   python3 gpu-wiki/scripts/query.py <operator-or-mechanism> --arch <arch> \
     --vendor <nvidia|amd> --dsl <dsl> --area reference-kernels --kind kernel
   ```
   Omit `--area` only when combined docs/reference results are useful. Narrow
   reference results with `--source`, `--status`, or `--kind`; test/build/package
   files require `--include-auxiliary`. Retry uncertain spellings with `--fuzzy`
   while keeping the same architecture/vendor/DSL filters. Copied filenames and
   paths work directly without fuzzy mode. Unknown filters must fail closed. Do
   not remove `--arch` to make an empty result look successful.
5. **Research strategy** (adaptive based on stall count):
   - **Normal mode** (`STALL_COUNT < 3`): No novelty requirement. Reusing known directions from `open_directions`, prior search findings, or profile evidence is not prohibited.
   - **Forced expansion mode** (`STALL_COUNT >= 3`): The previous directions have failed repeatedly — you MUST expand the search space. Do not limit searches to the current kernel's DSL/language; look at optimization techniques from **other languages or DSLs targeting the same or similar hardware architectures** (e.g., CUDA C++ tricks applicable to Triton, or CuteDSL patterns that inspire Gluon rewrites) and adapt the ideas. Execute the full three-layer progressive search (strict order):
     - **L1 (gpu-wiki)**: Translate bottleneck diagnoses from `profiles/v{{N}}/REPORT.md` into search keywords. Search architecture-scoped `gpu-wiki/docs/` first, then `gpu-wiki/reference-kernels/`. Only after those P0-P4 sources are insufficient, use `.claude/skills/KernelWiki` or `gpu-wiki/3rdparty/` as P5 sources for NVIDIA SM90/SM100.
     - **L2 (reference-projects)**: Only if L1 yields no new actionable path. Search relevant modules in `reference-projects/` for implementation patterns.
     - **L3 (public web)**: Only if L1+L2 yield nothing new. Use web search for papers, docs, or community posts.
     - The draft MUST contain at least one `New? = Yes` entry. If all layers produce no new finding, report search space exhaustion and stop — do not fabricate a draft or invoke gen-plan.
6. **Stop early**: Once you find **one viable optimization direction** with supporting evidence, proceed to draft immediately. Do not exhaustively search all layers.
7. **Write draft** to `plans/v{{N}}_draft.md` — a concise summary of:
   - Input Evidence: key metrics and diagnoses from `profiles/v{{N}}/REPORT.md`
   - Search findings: what you found (with Layer, New? annotations) and the chosen optimization direction
   - Constraints: target framework, platform, correctness requirements
   - Stall context: current `STALL_COUNT` and whether forced expansion was triggered
   - Performance expectation: a measurable post-change profile/latency expectation, plus the condition that would justify PTX/SASS inspection if compiler lowering could explain a mismatch
8. **Generate plan** via humanize:
   ```
   /humanize:gen-plan --input plans/v{{N}}_draft.md --output plans/v{{N}}_plan.md --direct
   ```
   This produces a structured plan with acceptance criteria. Use `--direct` to skip convergence rounds (one-shot generation appropriate for a single optimization action within the iteration loop).

**Output**: `plans/v{{N}}_plan.md` (generated by humanize) — the sole input for Stage 3.

### Stage 3 — Optimization Implementation

**Goal**: Implement exactly one optimization category from `plans/v{{N}}_plan.md` with clear evidence attribution.

Execution steps:

1. **Framework learning** (if needed): If the plan references framework APIs or operator interfaces you're unfamiliar with, search `gpu-wiki/reference-kernels/` or reference-projects first.
2. **Localization check**: If the change targets a symptom with a `LOCALIZE` line, ensure you have re-profiled with `--source` (see Stage 1 localization rule). Change only the specific line(s) the evidence identifies.
3. **Implement** the optimization action in `kernel.py`:
   - Change only one category per iteration (e.g., vectorized load only, swizzle only, double buffering only).
   - Each change must have clear evidence attribution (`evidence -> inference -> action`).
   - Do not mix unrelated refactors, formatting, or cleanup.
4. **Correctness validation** — immediately after editing:
   ```bash
   python tools/sandbox.py --no-sync -- python test_kernel.py --version v{{N}} --no-memory
   ```
   Parse the emitted `RESULT_JSON`, then update local `memory/v{{N}}.json`. If validation fails, iteratively
   fix until it passes. Do not proceed to Stage 4 with broken correctness.

   **Multi-seed robustness (MANDATORY before commit)**: A single-seed PASS is NOT sufficient.
   The production evaluator uses **freshly randomized inputs every call**, and a kernel that
   passes only on one seed can fail on another (numerical edge-cases, magnitude-dependent
   accumulation error, etc.). Before committing, run multi-seed validation:

   ```bash
   # Run 5 additional seeds (1..5). Reports PASS only if ALL seeds pass.
   python tools/sandbox.py --no-sync -- \
     python test_kernel.py --version v{{N}} --multi-seed 5 --no-memory
   ```

   Or, if you want explicit per-seed traces, run them one at a time:
   ```bash
   python tools/sandbox.py --no-sync -- python test_kernel.py --seed 1 --no-memory
   python tools/sandbox.py --no-sync -- python test_kernel.py --seed 2 --no-memory
   python tools/sandbox.py --no-sync -- python test_kernel.py --seed 3 --no-memory
   ```

   **ALL seeds must PASS.** If ANY seed fails correctness, the kernel is BROKEN — revert
   immediately with `git reset --hard HEAD`. Do NOT commit a kernel that passes only on
   specific seeds.

   Never rely on:
   - Input data values being stable across calls (no memoization / precomputation of outputs)
   - Tensor `data_ptr()` being stable (no pointer-equality caching)
   - Specific input patterns (no sentinel detection / value-dependent branching)
   - Cached computation results from previous calls (no `_cache` dict keyed by input values)

   Only shape/dtype/layout-based dispatch is safe. Weight format pre-conversion (transpose,
   contiguous) is allowed since weights are stable during evaluation.
5. **Create/update memory**:
   ```bash
   python tools/memory_manager.py create --workspace . --version v{{N}}
   python tools/memory_manager.py update --workspace . --version v{{N}} \
       --set 'optimization.action_category=<category>' \
       --set 'optimization.action_description=<description>'
   ```

**Output**: Modified `kernel.py` with correctness PASS, updated `memory/v{{N}}.json`.

### Stage 4 — Validate + Bench

**Goal**: Run the SOL-ExecBench harness for full performance measurement and quality gate.

Execution steps:

1. **Run the benchmark harness** with timeout guard:
   ```bash
   python tools/sandbox.py --no-sync -- python test_kernel.py --version v{{N}} --no-memory
   ```
   This runs the real `sol-execbench` evaluator over **every workload in `workload.jsonl`** with each workload's own tolerance. Do NOT edit `test_kernel.py` or hand-roll a separate test.
   Parse `RESULT_JSON` and write the metrics into local `memory/v{{N}}.json`; remote memory is never used.

2. **Metrics recorded** (locally from the sandbox `RESULT_JSON`):
   - `performance.latency_us` = **geomean** of per-workload kernel latency (primary objective: minimize)
   - `performance.latency_us_by_shape` — per-workload latency keyed by workload `uuid`
   - `performance.speedup_vs_ref_geomean` — geomean speedup vs reference
   - `correctness.status` / `quality_gate.result` — PASS iff ALL workloads pass

3. **Measurement reliability guard**: Before accepting a large delta (especially regressions >30%), re-run
   through the same sandbox hardware and compare; GPU selection belongs to the gateway, not local
   `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`.

4. **Quality gate**: PASS requires correctness PASS + geomean latency drop vs HEAD beyond measurement noise. A flat-within-noise result is NOT an improvement.

5. If `solution.json` needs updating (e.g. framework migration changed dependencies/entry_point), update it before benching.

**Output**: `memory/v{{N}}.json` with full performance data and quality gate result.

## Step C — Commit or revert (mechanical, no discretion)

- **Real win** (all workloads PASS **and** geomean kernel latency `performance.latency_us` drops vs HEAD by more
  than noise) → **commit** (skill Stage 5 format). This kernel becomes the new HEAD/best.
- **Otherwise** (geomean regression, flat-within-noise, or any workload FAIL) → `git reset --hard HEAD` to restore
  the best-known `kernel.py`. **Never commit a regression.** The goal is to minimize the geomean of kernel latency.

## Step D — Record + hand off (ALWAYS — win *or* dead-end)

Fill `memory/v{{N}}.json` regardless of outcome (`memory_manager.py create` then `update`, per the skill). It is
untracked until you commit it, so it survives `git reset --hard`.

- `performance`, `correctness`, `profile_evidence`, `optimization` (what you tried) — per `reference/v_iteration.schema.json`.
- `quality_gate` + `git_commit_hash` — set the hash if you committed; leave `null` if you reverted.
- **If this cycle was a dead-end**, record *why* in `search_log` / `pitfalls_and_fixes` so the next session doesn't repeat it.
- **`open_directions`** — up to **3** candidate leads for the *next* session, most-promising first (fewer is fine
  if you only found 1–2). Include any **unfinished-but-promising thread** you didn't get to. These are the "word
  for the next session":

  ```bash
  python tools/memory_manager.py update --workspace . --version v{{N}} \
    --set 'open_directions=[{"direction":"<lever>","rationale":"<evidence/why promising>"}]'
  ```

- **Profile-carry-forward** — if you committed, leave the post-edit profile in `profiles/v{{N}}/` so the next
  session can reuse it instead of re-profiling.
- **Commit the record** even on a revert, so the next session sees the dead-end:

  ```bash
  # win:  kernel.py already committed in Step C; amend the hash into memory.
  # revert: commit just the record —
  git add memory/v{{N}}.json plans/v{{N}}_draft.md plans/v{{N}}_plan.md && \
    git commit -m "v{{N}}: reverted (<reason>) — dead-end recorded"
  ```

## Finish

Print one line and stop — do **not** start another cycle:

```
v{{N}}: committed (+X.X%)   |   v{{N}}: reverted (<reason>)
```
