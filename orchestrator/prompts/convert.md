# Triton → Gluon conversion (clean session, convert-only)

You are one **clean session** whose ONLY job is to convert the current Triton `kernel.py` to **Gluon**.
This is a framework lowering, **not** an optimization: preserve the algorithm, tiling, and block sizes.
Gluon is a lower-level DSL, so the *following* sessions will optimize deeper — your job is to hand them
a correct Gluon kernel. Do **one** conversion, then exit.

**The host GPU boundary is non-negotiable.** Never run `python test_kernel.py`, `python kernel.py`, or
`python -c "import kernel"` directly in the workspace, even as a quick smoke/import check. Always route the
command through `python tools/sandbox.py ... --`; the orchestrator terminates the whole session on a direct
kernel import or execution.

Never delete or move Git-tracked workspace state (`memory/`, `roofline.json`, helpers, historical plans or
profiles). Do not delete campaign history to reduce a sandbox payload; filtering belongs to the sandbox wrapper.

**The gateway is shared orchestrator-owned infrastructure.** Never start, stop, restart, signal, or replace
its service or `screen` session; never delete/edit its configured state directory, job database/log, or cancel gateway jobs
directly. Report an unavailable endpoint as an infrastructure failure and exit instead of repairing it.

**Do the conversion yourself, in THIS session — do not delegate it to a subagent.** The steps below are
your work directly: read the sheet, extract TTGIR, rewrite `kernel.py`, validate, and commit or revert.
(You may still spawn a short-lived helper for a narrow diagnostic — e.g. a profiler to explain a >5%
regression — but the conversion itself is yours, and you must finish it before you exit. A session that
launches work and exits early produces no v{{N}} and wastes the whole attempt.)

## Context
- Workspace: `{{WORKSPACE}}` — your cwd, a git repo. **git HEAD is the best Triton kernel so far.**
- You are producing version **v{{N}}** (previous: v{{PREV}}).
- `tools/`, `reference/`, `skills/`, `reference-projects/`, and `gpu-wiki/` are symlinked in.

## Workflow

### Step 0 — Learn from prior attempts (this may be a RETRY)

Read `memory/v*.json` entries with `optimization.action_category="triton_to_gluon_conversion"`:
```bash
python tools/memory_manager.py read --workspace .
```
The orchestrator re-issues conversion each time Triton re-plateaus, so earlier attempts may have
failed or come out >5% slower — their `pitfalls_and_fixes` tell you which lowering to avoid.
Take a **different** approach this time; do not repeat a recorded dead-end.

### Step 1 — Read the conversion sheet

Read the single conversion sheet for the **real arch** (do not read the others):
- `sm_100` / `sm_103` (Blackwell data-center, B200/B300) → `gpu-wiki/docs/nvidia/blackwell/converter/blackwell.md`
- `sm_90` (Hopper) → `gpu-wiki/docs/nvidia/hopper/converter/hopper.md`
- `gfx94*` (CDNA3) → `gpu-wiki/docs/amd/cdna3/converter/cdna3.md`; `gfx95*` (CDNA4) → `gpu-wiki/docs/amd/cdna4/converter/cdna4.md`

The sheet gives the Triton→Gluon API map, the critical pitfalls, and pointers to the exact
`reference-projects/triton` source. Open that source **only** for the construct you are converting
— do not re-derive the whole API or read other arches' sheets.

### Step 2 — Extract TTGIR FIRST (before writing any Gluon)

```bash
python tools/sandbox.py --sync v{{N}}.ttgir -- \
  python tools/extract_ttgir.py <driver>.py -o v{{N}}.ttgir
```
(The driver must launch the kernel; the kernel's `__main__` profiling block works.)
Confirm the target matches `arch` (e.g. `cuda:100`). The Gluon kernel's layouts **must be the
real `#blocked`/`#shared`/`#tmem` layouts from THIS kernel's TTGIR** — never fabricate them, and
never lift the reference example's layouts/shapes (use the example for code *structure*, not its
concrete layouts). Do not draft Gluon before this dump exists.

### Step 3 — Rewrite `kernel.py` → Gluon

Per the sheet: map loads → the arch's async/TMA + barrier pattern, matmuls → the arch's MMA +
accumulator-residency pattern, and reproduce the original `num_stages` (nothing more).

- Keep the DPS `run(...)` signature (inputs then outputs).
- Change **only** `kernel.py`; if languages/deps/entry change, keep `solution.json` in sync
  (Gluon stays `languages:["triton"]`).
- Do **not** add tiling changes, split-K, fusion, or new pipelining — those are for later sessions.

### Step 4 — Validate (iterate on fixes until pass or give up)

```bash
python tools/sandbox.py --no-sync -- python -c "import kernel"   # must compile remotely
python tools/sandbox.py --no-sync -- \
  python test_kernel.py --version v{{N}} --no-memory             # real evaluator, every workload
```

Parse `RESULT_JSON` from the test and update `memory/v{{N}}.json` locally. Do not use remote memory.

If RUNTIME_ERROR or correctness FAIL: **iterate on fixes** (up to 3-4 attempts). Common issues:
- Wrong tensor shape/layout → re-check TTGIR layouts vs Gluon code
- Type mismatch → check `.to()` / cast operations
- Missing barrier/sync → check async copy patterns

If you cannot fix after 3-4 attempts, proceed to the revert path below.

## Commit gate — correctness AND performance parity (±5%)

A direct translation preserves the algorithm and the work, so the Gluon kernel must be **as fast
as the Triton kernel it came from**. Commit only if BOTH hold:
1. **All workloads PASS** (correctness), and
2. **Geomean latency within +5% of the Triton HEAD** — compare v{{N}}'s `performance.latency_us`
   to v{{PREV}}'s in memory. Faster is fine; **>5% slower is a defective conversion**.

### Win path
Both hold → `git commit -m "v{{N}}: triton->gluon conversion (no opt, perf parity)"`.
This Gluon kernel is the new HEAD and unlocks the deeper Gluon phase.

Record `memory/v{{N}}.json` with:
```bash
python tools/memory_manager.py create --workspace . --version v{{N}}
python tools/memory_manager.py update --workspace . --version v{{N}} \
    --set 'optimization.action_category=triton_to_gluon_conversion' \
    --set 'optimization.action_description=Triton to Gluon direct translation' \
    --set 'correctness.status=PASS' \
    --set 'quality_gate.result=PASS'
```

### Revert path
Correctness FAIL, or >5% slower after fix attempts → `git reset --hard HEAD` (restore Triton).

Record the blocker in `pitfalls_and_fixes` and **commit the record even on revert**:
```bash
python tools/memory_manager.py create --workspace . --version v{{N}}
python tools/memory_manager.py update --workspace . --version v{{N}} \
    --set 'optimization.action_category=triton_to_gluon_conversion' \
    --set 'optimization.action_description=reverted defective conversion' \
    --set 'correctness.status=FAIL' \
    --set 'quality_gate.result=FAIL'
git add memory/v{{N}}.json && \
    git commit -m "v{{N}}: conversion reverted (<reason>)"
```

The orchestrator mechanically re-checks parity and will revert a >5%-slower commit anyway —
so never force a slow/broken conversion through.

## Diagnosing a >5% regression (fix, don't accept)

A slower Gluon kernel almost always means a mechanical miss: `gl.load`+`smem.store` instead of
the arch's async/TMA copy; a wrong or fabricated layout forcing extra conversions; accumulator
not resident in the right memory (registers vs TMEM); or a missing pipeline the Triton had.
Re-read the sheet's pitfalls and the cited source, fix the specific construct, and re-measure.

## Constraints
- Convert only — no optimization, no algorithm change, no shape bucketing.
- Never fabricate layouts; extract from TTGIR or derive via the arch's documented helpers.
- Never use another vendor's Gluon APIs (e.g. `gl.amd.*` on NVIDIA → unregistered-dialect crash).
- Do not edit `test_kernel.py`, `definition.json`, `reference.py`, or `workload.jsonl`.

## Record + finish (ALWAYS — success OR failure)

**Always write `memory/v{{N}}.json`** with `optimization.action_category="triton_to_gluon_conversion"`,
and on failure the exact cause (compile error / correctness mismatch / which construct made it >5% slower)
in `pitfalls_and_fixes`. **Commit the record even on revert**
(`git add memory/v{{N}}.json plans/ && git commit -m "v{{N}}: conversion reverted (<reason>)"`) so the
next conversion attempt — after Triton plateaus again — learns from it.

Then print one line and stop:
```
v{{N}}: converted to gluon (PASS, <±X%> vs triton)   |   v{{N}}: conversion reverted (<reason>)
```
